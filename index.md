# What is trend following?

Trend following is an investment strategy that aims to capitalize on the directional movement, or trends, in financial markets. Followers of this strategy believe that assets tend to move in persistent directions over time. 

> Trend followers typically buy or sell assets based on the direction of the prevailing trend, attempting to ride the trend for as long as possible to maximize profits. 

Trend following is characterized by its systematic and disciplined approach, with practitioners aiming to minimize losses during periods of market volatility while capturing gains during trend movements.

This approach involves using technical analysis tools to identify and confirm trends: moving averages, different types of price channels, Bollinger bands, Supertrend and so on. 

Different researches say that they all give approximately the same results if you choose approximately the same settings.

Therefore, any of these tools can be used.


# Black Box Trend Following

Idea of this strategy was proposed in article "Black Box Trend Following - Lifting the Veil". Authors: Nigol Koulajian and Paul Czkwianianc. The authors of this paper are principals of Quest Partners LLC, trading company manages $2.3 billion in assets.

I coded this as a script in Tradingview:

# Script description

Strategy uses two channels. One channel - for opening trades. Second channel - for closing. Channel is similar to Donchian channel, but uses Close prices (not High/Low). 
* * *
Strategy waits for beginning of trend - when price breakout of channel. Default length of both channels = 50 candles.

Conditions of trading:

* Open Long: If last Close = max Close for 50 closes.
* Close Long: If last Close = min Close for 50 closes.
* Open Short: If last Close = min Close for 50 closes.
* Close Short: If last Close = max Close for 50 closes.

* * *

Color of lines:

- black - channel for opening trade.
- red - channel for closing trade.
- yellow - entry price.
- fuchsia - stoploss and breakeven.
- vertical green - go Long.
- vertical red - go Short.
- vertical gray - close in end, don't trade anymore.

* * *

Order size calculated with ATR and volatility.

You can't trade 1 contract in BTC and 1 contract in XRP - for example. They have different price and volatility, so 1 contract BTC not equal 1 contract XRP.

Script uses universal calculation for every market. It is based on:
* Risk - USD sum you ready to loss in one trade. It calculated as percent of Equity.
* ATR indicator - measurement of volatility.

With default setting your stoploss = 0.5 percent of equity:

- If initial capital is 1000 USD and used parameter "Permit stop" - loss will be 5 USD (0.5 % of equity).
- If your Equity rises to 2000 USD and used parameter "Permit stop"- loss will be 10 USD (0.5 % of Equity).

* * *
This Risk works only if you enable “Permit stop” parameter in Settings.

If this parameter disabled - strategy works as reversal strategy:
* If close Long - channel border works as stoploss and momentarily go Short.
* If close Short - channel border works as stoploss and momentarily go Long.

Channel borders changed dynamically. So sometime your loss will be greater than ‘Risk %’. Sometime - less than ‘Risk %’.

If this parameter enabled - maximum loss always equal to 'Risk %'. This parameter also include breakeven: if profit % = Risk %, then move stoploss to entry price.

* * *

Like all trend following strategies - it works only in trend conditions. If no trend - slowly bleeding. There is no special additional indicator to filter trend/notrend. You need to trade every signal of strategy.

Strategy gives many losses:
* 30 % of trades will close with profit.
* 70 % of trades will close with loss.
* But profit from 30% will be much greater than loss from 70 %.

Your task - patiently wait for it and don't use risky setting for position sizing.

* * *

Recommended timeframe - Daily.

* * *

Trend can vary in lengths. Selecting length of channels determine which trend you will be hunting:
* 20/10 - from several days to several weeks.
* 20/20 or 50/20 - from several weeks to several months.
* 50/50 or 100/50 or 100/100 - from several months to several years.

* * *

Inputs (Settings):

* Length: length of channel for trade opening/closing. You can choose 20/10, 20/20, 50/20, 50/50, 100/50, 100/100. Default value: 50/50.

* Permit Long / Permit short: Longs are most profitable for this strategy. You can disable Shorts and enable Longs only. Default value: permit all directions.

* Risk % of Equity: for position sizing used Equity percent. Don't use values greater than 5 % - it's risky. Default value: 0.5%.

* ATR multiplier: this multiplier moves stoploss up or down. Big multiplier = small size of order, small profit, stoploss far from entry, low chance of stoploss. Small multiplier = big size of order, big profit, stop near entry, high chance of stoploss. Default value: 2.

* ATR length: number of candles to calculate ATR indicator. It used for order size and stoploss. Default value: 20.

* Close in end - to close active trade in the end (and don't trade anymore) or leave it open. You can see difference in Strategy Tester. Default value: don’t close.

* Permit stop: use stop or go reversal. Default value: without stop, reversal strategy.
